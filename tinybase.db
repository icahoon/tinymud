Statue of Garrett
You see two statues, carved out of a single piece of marble. One is a panda, waist height to a man, who looks at you with big panda eyes. The other is a human, male, sitting lazily on the ground. He has an enormous grin on his face as he scratches the panda behind the ears. The panda looks pleased. On the man's shoulder is a dragon, three-headed, two-tailed.

A shining golden statue of a long-tailed Lynx prowling through an unseen jungle rests here. The Lynx has brilliantly crystalline fangs and claws of great sharpness, but his large sapphire eyes gleam with warmth and affection, and his tufted ears are focused at you attentively.

Unfinished statue
This once blocky piece of dirty red sandstone has been roughly knocked, beaten, and chipped into the figure of a man. The top of the statue seems to be most defined, and the bottom least, as if he were caught rising from the depths of formlessness. He gazes back at you; his eyes are filled with a great sadness, but are also comforted by true friendship, as you can see by their warm inner glow.

Temple Entryway
This dark path leads from the outside world into The Temple. A raised stone pathway runs inward to the east, and back out to the west. Cold stone statues sit high up in the darkness, judging passers-by with scrutinizing eyes. Thick, rich curtains, the color of dried blood, line the north and south walls of this dark hallway; they seem to move slightly due to some mysterious presence. One might imagine that the curtains were stained by drippings from the statues' mouths.

Travellers from strange lands, both near and far, lurk among the shadows, hot smoke, and flickering red light cast by the pit, waiting to drop sacrifices to the deity of their choice.

This form, fortunately (?), is the simple, easy version of a much longer form, hence the -EZ suffix. It consists of about 27 different pages, each of which must be filled out in septuplicate; needless to say, one must press down hard when writing. The regular print on this form is so small as to be almost unreadable; the fine print shows up as long, fuzzy horizontal lines.

A sign for builders is attached underneath the first sign.
You are advised to use an unlinked exit from the TransPort Designer's Teleport Room (south, west, north) to start building your area or home; after you're done, meet with a wizard or another builder to see about linking your area in consistently with the other areas. See the Map Room if you'd like to find good places to develope!

The Trash Bin
The Builders of the Temple, in their infinite wisdom, wisely placed the Administration and The Trash Bin next to each other, hidden away from the rest of the Temple. Would you want such nasty, smelly things in front of your nose all the time? All sorts of lovely trash lies around here, from banana peels to old, unprocessed forms. A rather unsanitary door leads back out, to the north, which allows this room and the administration to remain in a constant mutual state of spillover.

Designer's Instruction Manual (Part 2) for TransPort
When you complete your area, you should leave a note here or in the city planning office (as appropiate) to the wizards. They will then get in touch with you, do quality control on your area, and open up links so you can put your area in topologically with the others. You can put an announcement in the kiosk, and the wizards will put your area in the map room in the library; after that, it's up to you to make your area popular.

The streets are marked off into intersections, through which you can travel quickly with the stepdisc directions "nn", "ee", "ss", and "ww".

You can link an exit to send players home (with their inventory) by "@link <dir>=home". Drop-tos can also be set to 'home' (See DROP-TOS). See @LINK.

Bogus commands can be made using exits. For example, to make a 'sit' command, one could "@open sit", then "@link sit=here" (because unlinked exits can be stolen), "@lock sit=me&!me" (impossible to be both at once, therefore always fails), and "@fail sit=You sit on the chair."; "@ofail=sits on the chair.". Since nobody can go through it, it always fails. The @fail message is displayed to the player, and the @ofail message (preceded by the player's name) to everyone else.
