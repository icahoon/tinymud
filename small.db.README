Notes to new administrators using small.db:

1. There are four objects of type player in small.db: Wizard(#1),
Beaker(#2), guy(#121), and Darooha(#203).  As distributed, all have
the password "potrzebie."  Wizard is the administrative player; it is
the only one that has its WIZARD bit set, and it owns most of the core
rooms.  Beaker is included for testing.  guy and Darooha own the
"Eastward Ho" and "Bud's" adventures; if you want to leave these
samples out, you can remove them using extract.  Only the Wizard and
the objects owned by the Wizard are really important...

2. Small.db contains no unlinked exits; thus it will be impossible for
anybody who is not a WIZARD to connect new rooms to the core rooms.
When TinyMUD was first started up on LANCELOT.AVALON.CS.CMU.EDU, the
Town Square was given 9 unlinked exits (7 of the 8 cardinal directions
plus up and down) and was set to be LINK_OK; this allowed early
construction to take place in the neighborhood of the Town Square
without the need for administrative oversight.  

While this policy worked well during the early lifetime of the game,
as the database grew the immediate surroundings of the Town Square
became rather chaotic, and only a few of the directions exits from it
got much use.  It might be reasonable to build a more extensive Town
Center before allowing haphazard construction.

You might want instead to get a copy of TinyBASE, a more logical and
complete basis for starting a new MUD.
